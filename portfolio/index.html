            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Greetings! My Dafrosa Mbanga, thank you for taking the time to go through my portfolio site. I am a tech enthusiast who has been actively learning about tech and tech-enabled fields and how they impact modern-day business operations, the workplace, and the career landscape. I have expecially been drawn to Software Engineering how the field creates tools and resources that significantly impact modern-day business operations and workplace. So, I joined ALX Africa and have been actively pursuing my Software Engineering career aspirations with the organization. I am known to catch a creativity bug here and there, a couple of months I explored my creativity bug by learning about SEO and Copywriting. In my explorations of the creativity bug, I got SEO Certified by HubSpotAcademy and created 3 SEO Content Assets for a tech company solving the experience gap in the job market. I am excited about getting advanced knowledge in the Software Engineering field and get to explore creativity and create value within the field.
